## Machine learning and statistical inference 

I heard this term machine learning from the Stanford U online open course, when I was in my fresh year of college. 
Which attracts me instantly by the magic machines can do.
I did watch a few courses online. And have some basic understanding about what we can do with machine learning.
But the time I first formally get into it is when I took a course in my master degree, which is taught by Prof Tao. 
Prof Tao is not only a great scholar but also a good teacher. 
He leads me to the door of data mining and machine learning.

I come to know clustering and classifier and regression and other technics. And I did two course project in K-means and association rule mining, which both got A.
And in the second semester of master degree, I took a course by Dr. Au Yueng, social network analysis.
In which, I start not only by assigned course project, but also to do something innovating. 
We did a twitter features and stock prize regression, find the correlation between features and stock prize change.
Also during my master degree, I also joined Prof Chan's research team, bootstrapped simple recommendation algorithm in e-learning platform.

After I graduated, I joined the Noah's Ark Lab. 
From here, I am getting more and more chance to learn and use practical machine learning technics and also statistical skills.
I did use brief propagation in my paper and used topic model and svdfeature to another internal projects.
As the research needs, I start to get into many other classical models, state of art algorithms.
And I begin to have my understanding about machine learning.
As to machine learning related research, it can be divided into two parts. 
First, try to formalize the problem in any shape of function or equations.
Second, with help of optimization to achieve the answer to the problem.
When we are doing the first step, different characters of functions, distributions and so on need to be considered.
And also, real world situations need to be related with the formally definition.
And when it comes to the second step, more mathematic and statistical experience is needed.
Since, the problem has becoming pure mathematical notation, the focus in more about how to get parameters, which can get our step one problem optimal solution.


Works in my current lab, it gives me a chance to try matrix based, topic model based, probabilistic based, tree based, deep leaning based models and know the limitation and strength of them. 
I learn from coursera after work and whenever have problems; lots of friendly researchers can help.
So in conclusion, my self-assessment is: I have ideas about machine learning and have some inside knowledge around several models like topic based, matrix based and etc.
Models are just technics, there is no silver bullet, so whenever one research problem appears, adaptive solutions need to be customized to it.

And as I am more of an application oriented, maybe I am not very good at proving the mathematic fundamentals. But I know the characters of them and know how and when to use them.
But still the more models I learn, the bold my idea can be, and better solutions to real world problems can be found. And I keep on learning.
